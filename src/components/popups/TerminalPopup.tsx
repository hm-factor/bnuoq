                        Formed in January 2020, Cohort B is an avant-punk outfit 
                        born out of Queens, New York. While members Hunter Factor, 
                        Jhonny Núñez, and Don Pardo all share a similar, yet 
                        eclectic taste of musical influences, their sound is 
                        reminiscent of the sickening rhythms of 80's no-wave 
                        mixed with fierce hardcore aggression, by way of prog-rock 
                        style songwriting execution. The goal is to corral their 
                        followers along in the process, leaving them asking 
                        questions like "what the fuck is that sound?"

                        All of his skin
                        With matters so urgent
                        Have you seen where his face went?
                        Oh im aware
                        Yes Ive been aware

                        This movement to the next
                        Has gotten me in a bind
                        with death in its playground 
                        But its so clear to me now
                    </div>

                    a man sinks into his seat
                    oh how good he couldve had it
                    if he just hadnt
                    drowned his frustrations in a sea of red lights
                    breeding frustration anew
                    "what am i doing?"
                    "where am i going?"

                    And he says to himself

                    and Ive been known to use
                    and Ive been known to use

                    This hammer is my sentence
                    these cold repeats so frequent 
                    Confined to a room 
                    With nothing but his secrets

                    Am I using this term right am I losing my edge 
                    Am I running in circles trying to find an end 
                    Have I gotten my fill?
                    Have I seen it all
                    Have I seen enough?

                    Aint no one wholl let you know when youre hanging loose
                    But theyll tell you that its for a cause
                    And when your efforts dont cut it 
                    You failed your teachers 
                    and now youre saying
                    “I cant make it anywhere”
                    By asking anyone
                    So its only right 
                    if I could take a bigger slice
                    But just so you know
                    Its made to entice 
                    Its by design

                    And if youre looking for a free throw
                    Youve got it made
                    Now youre getting paid 
                    And all for what?
                    Making shit 
                    that you thought wed need
                    This mommas got mouths to feed
                    This architectures giving me anxiety

                    My entire life
                    I was relieved
                    Of the need to reach for the stars
                    So I became the one
                    Whose job it was to clean the dust 
                    From those who scored 
                    from daddys trust 
                    I said too much but its okay 
                    Privileged to work for you any day

                    I hate the sound of chains that bind
                    So I taught myself to wrap that shit 
                    round my teeth and bite back

                    Hey, could you be a little clearer
                    why cant you let us get ahead 
                    do you fear us?
                    You call it reparations 
                    I call it empty gestures 
                    Now its not enough
                    Now its not enough

                    Whyd you give up on me
                    Why would you give me up
                    Whyd you give up on me
                    Why wont you give me —

                    If i could be just a bit stronger,
                    would I even be an option?
                    if i could grow an inch or two,
                    would i still be under your thumb?
                    Strange that you would be the kind 
                    to share this out
                    (if i dont who will)
                    I tried to please you,
                    won have won hear it 
                    Funny how it seems 
                    we keep on going thru the 
                    same shit.
                    Aint it strange?

                    He bares a hand at no expense 
                    reject your offer, wishes you the best
                    No clue where I come from, 
                    so give it a guess
                    “Its a lot to process”, so process this: Theres nothing more 
                    personal than 
                    a purse thats been 
                    emptied out on the pavement.
                    Still too much to process,
                    well process this!

                    Well Ill tell you what I think
                    just dont take it to heart
                    if a succubus stood next you
                    I couldnt tell you apart
                    Heaving and shaking
                    cold sweat in the night
                    I worry if Im coming off 
                    a little too nice
                    Yeah I worry if Im coming off 
                    A little too nice

                    Yeah Ill sure be the one 
                    to catch the words drooling out
                    saying what i said but youre not saying much 
                    the truth in camo as digestible lies
                    so ill dig it out 
                    and blow dirt in your eyes
                    your dead in the eyes 
                    dead in the eyes 
                    dead in the eyes

                    are you someone 
                    that looks to be understood?
                    automatic speech 
                    giving me all i need to know
                    he left his iron by the window 
                    Watch that fuckin grin
                    the only thing i know you wont cover up

                    words have you bastardized
                    the streets were asked and your name was called
                    I keep one hand on the mic
                    only sense of control 
                    your pockets full  
                    only handing us back these clouds of rust
                    looking back 
                    i couldnt see a better face to trust
                    
                    once i had a calling
                    once i heard the whispers
                    once i came across this shining piece

                    could you imagine if your first time
                    would end up being your last time
                    make it make sense
                    this passing moment immortalized in the line between macabre and reality 
                    one in the same
                    you come to the point where you wake up before you say good night
                    if you thought this was a game, guess whos being played
                    you get so emotional about going through the motions
                    its so easy just forget you had a choice in the matter and youll be fine

                    my dad, 
                    he gave up on this city life
                    not a care 
                    not a wince
                    no sleep in his eyes
                    walk around in his boots
                    Im stepping on pebbles and mud
                    if i could be frank 
                    no one knows what this man was like
                </div>

                    shes got his hand pressed against his breast
                    connection; a subtle form of arrest 
                    at least thats the impression that he gets
                    its his world and this is how he chooses to cope with sex

                    liberty from ashin the skin
                    maybe Id have more to say
                    if I gnashed my teeth in
                    a good book or try a long walk on the town
                    named after the crown
                    all the spoils that surround

                    pays to be alert
                    course its nothing but a blur
                    casualties forgotten as soon as they occur
                    maybe Id come around after being graced with this gift
                    maybe Id be more enthused if I wasnt over 
                    over this shit

                    wait
                    it's coming together now
                    just any minute now
                    just any minute now

                    my jaw jutting out of sheer tension 
                    a fresh take on a festering wound
                    i feel i got a lump the size of pumice stone down my throat
                    smoothing out these edges just to have a cleaner approach
                    running out of teeth to collect from the limestone tiles
                    so i zoomed to catch nearest coat
                    its not in my best interest to pack on any more pounds
                    i suppose theres more than 10 ways to wear yourself 
                    out

                    at my pace
